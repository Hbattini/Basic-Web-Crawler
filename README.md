# Basic-Web-Crawler
A coding challenge I was issued, my first time trying to make a functioning WebCrawler. Its slow and inefficient but it gets the job done. 
Main code is in imagefinder/src/main/java/com/eulerity/hackathon/imagefinder/ It will crawl any webpage and return the pictures to a localhost: 8080 that is run using maven. First time using maven as well.
